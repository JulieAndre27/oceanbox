# oceanbox

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for a computer session during the [GFD Week](https://geoflows2023.sciencesconf.org) organized for the Masters program at the Department of Physics at ENS de Lyon.

The goal is to illustrate potential mechanisms for millenial-scale variability in the ocean using simple box models of the buoyancy-driven circulation.
