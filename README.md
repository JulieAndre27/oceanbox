# oceanbox

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook used for a computer tutorial for the lecture "Introduction Ã  la physique du climat et aux impacts du changement climatique" of Master M1 ICFP.

The goal is to illustrate potential mechanisms for millenial-scale variability in the ocean using simple box models of the buoyancy-driven circulation.

The original files have been prepared by Corentin Herbert in a joint work to prepare climate tutorials between ENS and ENS de Lyon.
